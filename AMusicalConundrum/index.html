            <h1>A Musical Conundrum</h1>

            <p>Here's one of my favorite albums to listen to! I should warn you, though, that I have a very peculiar way that I like to listen to things, so I've also attached a set of listening instructions for you to get what I think will be the best experience out of it.</p>

            <p>Even though I really like this album, none of the tracks are actually my #1 favorite song. You should be able to figure it out, though, just by listening carefully. Enjoy the music!</p>

            <p>
                Let's start at the beginning, naturally! We should listen to the first song in
                the album, starting from when they say the name of the song. Oh, but it doesn't
                get good until a little while in, so skip ahead a verse, to the part where the
                background instrumental changes. Actually, skip ahead another verse, about the
                same amount of time. Nice, now we're at the good part. Oh, I just love how they
                pronounce the "d" at the end of the first word in this verse! Okay, let's keep
                listening a bit longer... I love the way they say the word "with" too! And a
                few words after, that one that starts with "b"! Okay, let's stop at the word
                immediately after that "b" one and go to the next song.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't want to listen to too much of this one, since I don't like it as much.
                They do enunciate the vowels at the beginning of words really nicely, though.
                Let's listen to the words that start with vowels... oh, for the first few
                they're the same vowel. Let's stop on the first one which starts with a
                different vowel. Yeah, that's enough of that – we should move on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Oh, the first verse of this one has the same phrase repeated three times! The
                verse ends right after the third time it's said – I don't like all the
                repetition, so let's start on the word right after that, which starts with an
                "i". Oh right, the next verse starts with two rhyming lines. Let's stop on the
                rhyming word which comes later in the alphabet, and then move to the next song.
                Oh, no, I actually hate that one... let's skip that one and listen to the next
                instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                I like the way they say the word "little" in this one; let's start there. Why
                don't we just keep listening... actually, wait, this word ends with "y", which
                means we went too far. Step back a word, and then go forward until you hear a
                word with a "j" sound in it – no, wait, that's still too far! Step back 5
                words from here. Ah, yes, that's perfect! Stop right there – actually, let's
                just stop the whole song and move on to the next one. Oh, I don't like this one
                either; let's skip one again.
            </p>

            <p>
                I know exactly the part I like in this song! Start at the first time they say
                the name of the song, and then listen up until a four-letter word containing
                the letter "r". Then listen for one word longer. Perfect! Once again, let's
                skip the next song.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ugh, I can barely tolerate this one. Just listen up until the first definite
                article and move on.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first verse of this one is pretty cool; let's listen to it. The second
                verse is not quite as good... just listen up until the first two-letter word.
                There should be exactly one among the first 5 words of the second verse, I
                think.
            </p>

            <p>
                This one's fine. The first few words aren't very good, so start at the first
                word that ends with an "n" (it should still be in the first line). Okay, let's
                listen to... say, 12 more words, and that'll be enough. And let's skip the next
                song again.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is one of my favorite songs – not just in this album but in
                general!<sup>1</sup> You should be able to figure out how long I want you to
                listen to this one by now, but since it's so good, just listen to the whole
                thing instead. :)
