            <pre><code>--- Day 26: Intriguing Images ---

As it turns out, the soft-serve machine isn't quite working as expected. You
thought you fixed it, and while it does produce soft-serve now, the labels on
the buttons are all broken and not displaying correctly. This makes for a very
poor user experience, so Santa is requesting that you quickly patch it before
leaving.

It sounds like a simple fix to you at first, but you soon realize that the
image encoding that the soft-serve machine uses is very... unusual. After a bit
of fiddling, you're able to deduce that it at least stores images in the
familiar <strong>RGB hexadecimal format</strong>, but it's very primitive in that it simply
lists <strong>pixels in order, left to right and top to bottom</strong>.

To make matters worse, it seems like the programmers haven't even bothered to
specify the <strong>dimensions of the images</strong>. You're not sure how the machine knows how
many pixels go on each row... maybe it has something to do with enforcing a
<strong>reasonable aspect ratio</strong> or something.

As if that's not bad enough, there appears to be some kind of preprocessing
step. The <strong>first line of every image file</strong> contains an instruction or program of
some sort, which gets <strong>applied to each individual byte</strong> (the red, green, and blue
values) of each pixel. For example, if one of the pixels is given as <em>dd8810</em>,
then its actual red, green, and blue values are <em>f(0xdd)</em>, <em>f(0x88)</em>, and <em>f(0x10)</em>
respectively (where <em>f</em> is the function given by the first line). You have no
idea why images are possibly implemented this way -- maybe it's some sort of
barebones "security" measure? Whatever the reason, it's very... <strong>esoteric</strong>.

Anyway, here are a few example image files, and what they're supposed to look
like (enlarged for your convenience):

<div>+
feffff
fffeff
fffffe
ffffff</div> <img src='ex1.png' alt='left to right, and top to bottom: red, green, blue, black' title='left to right, and top to bottom: red, green, blue, black'>

<div>[--&gt;+&lt;]&gt;
fe0000
00fe00
0000fe
fefefe</div> <img src='ex2.png' alt='left to right, and top to bottom: dark red, dark green, dark blue, gray' title='left to right, and top to bottom: dark red, dark green, dark blue, gray'>

<div>&gt;------------------------------
012345
abcdef
654321
aaaaaa</div> <img src='ex3.png' alt='whole image is light gray' title='whole image is light gray'>

Wow, these programs are really hurting your <strong>brain</strong>.

There appears to be one last, much larger image which a previous developer left
behind for documentation purposes. From what you've seen, you're guessing it
has to do with the programming language that the soft-serve machine is running.
Its source code looks like gibberish to you and you haven't been able to figure
out what language it is, but if you can, you think you'll have a very good shot 
at debugging the issue.
